**Details of investor job functions:** 

1. Capital allocation: Stock investors allocate their capital to various investment opportunities in the market. They aim to invest in stocks that have the potential to generate attractive returns, while diversifying their portfolio to mitigate risk.
2. Research and analysis: Stock investors need to perform thorough research and analysis of the companies they are interested in investing in. This includes examining financial statements, assessing industry trends, evaluating management performance, and analyzing macroeconomic factors that may impact the company's growth prospects and stock valuation.
3. Risk management: Investors need to manage the risks associated with their investments. This involves identifying potential risks, assessing their potential impact on the portfolio, and employing appropriate strategies to mitigate or hedge against these risks.
4. Portfolio management: Stock investors need to manage their portfolio effectively, ensuring that it is well-diversified and aligned with their investment goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. This may involve periodic rebalancing of the portfolio, adding or removing stocks, and adjusting asset allocation as needed.
5. Performance monitoring: Investors need to keep track of the performance of their investments, regularly reviewing and comparing them against benchmarks or target returns. This enables them to make informed decisions about adjusting their portfolio or investment strategy if necessary.
6. Staying informed: Stock investors need to stay informed about market developments, changes in economic conditions, and industry trends. This includes keeping up-to-date with financial news, analyst reports, and company announcements, as well as attending conferences, webinars, or other educational events.
